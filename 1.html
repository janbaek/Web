    There’s a lot of hype around coding, so let’s start by clarifying what coding isn’t.<p> I mentioned above that when I first saw the source code of a web page, I thought that I was looking at the language my computer spoke. This is a common way of explaining what code is, but it’s not exactly true.
    Your computer doesn’t understand the nuances of language.</p> <p style="margin-top:45px;">In fact, the only terms your computer understands very well at all are “Yes” or “No.”
    Imagine you are building a bridge with a group of engineers.</p> You’re on one side, they are on the other, and you need to communicate to finish the project. The problem is, your phone has died, and your radio only works one way. All you have to communicate with them is a flashlight. One flash for yes, two for no. It will take a whil
    <P> but, eventually, the bridge will be built.</P>
    This is how a computer communicates with people. The language the computer speaks is binary code, a mathematical language of ones and zeros. Just like the flashlight, there are only two options. The computer understands “on” and “off,”  and nothing else. So unless you’re typing strings of ones and zeros into your text editor (which you’re not), you’re not really writing code in the computer’s language.
    But if the code isn’t written in the computer’s language, what are you doing?
